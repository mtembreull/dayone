		<p class="grid-2"> KIM HYESOON; Metaphor Ban; Metaphor has been stolen from the poet. The ocean is no longer a place of metaphor. n’t said metaphorically in a poem that she was entering water. A ribbon of metaphor was tied on the vast world. Forgiveness must be sought for these acts.<br>Seasons have been stolen from the poet. After spring, summer does not follow. It is hot winter. Flowers blossom all at once then die all at once. n’t, who once described a bud of a flower was like a tightly held fist. As a metaphor in a poem, must seek forgiveness.<br>God was stolen from n’t.<br>It is now hard to pray to God.<br>For the chirping songs of baby chicks, forgiveness must be sought. This spring, the chicks got stuck on fences. They hang from people’s chests and sleeves.<br>Black rain raining on stolen spring. From the eaves, pink flesh of stolen God. Splattering down down down. I can’t bring myself to say that even the ocean is stolen.<br>Is there any metaphor in this country now.<br>Perhaps if we are forgiven.<br>Perhaps if every poem in this world is forgiven.<br>(translation by Jack Jung)</p>

		<p class="grid-2">RACHEL BETESH; The Fine Air; tasting of pine, clear breath of it, appetite for feeling spent, shovel-surge light, lighter than it looks, but these are trees made small.<br>wind of it, delivery, spilled out in pieces: stems, wood-knots, anything that pushed back.<br>heave of it, only the pile was heavy; not the lift, arm by arm.<br>that was easy, the way branches look, how they just keep heading out into it, the fine air of fir-tips where that’s all right.</p>

		<p class="grid-2">JORY MICKELSON; It Was the Year Without; It was the mouthlark, I mean it was morning, the light sent like a text to our dreams.<br>It was the year without romance. The skinnyjeaned boy never left his room. His chuck taylors stayed impossiblely clean.<br>The neighbor’s threadbare dog, stitched its way across town, until everyone knew when to look out the windows expectantly.<br>The only clock was frogsong. It was the year we planted gardens and let our lawns go. No one went to work. People drank the golden hour like smooth bourbon without worrying if it was watered down.<br>The dullhum of insects sat like an empty glass. Taxes were paid in bundles of red twigs from the willows along the lake that was really a pond. The economy was the division of spring bulbs and their eventual return.<br>We learned to love the dying light of our screens, like it was the end of the world. Each day we waited for the dog to come limping past with the sun in its mouth.<br>When he came, like a watchman at daybreak, we stepped from our houses and into our wings.<br>We sang.</p>

						<p>Foldy is a simplified mobile first responsive grid. It's based on the <a href="http://960.gs">960 Grid</a>, and is designed for people (like us at <a href="http://paravelinc.com">Paravel</a>) who are transitioning into Responsive Web Design. It's ugly on purpose. It's not a framework or a drop-in solution, it's a starting point. It's a launch pad that is made to be customzied such as the exapmle below.</p>

  				<p>One common task in responsive web design is making a grid of thumbs collapse into a 2-column grid. Foldy makes this easy. 6 is the magic number. And it should be easy enough to understand how the simplified grid works that you could modify it yourself.</p>
