		<h3>How many quarters have you attended EvCC?</h3>
		<p>I currently am not a full time student at EvCC. I am a full time employee in eLearning & CTT. I have worked for EvCC for 11 years; eight years in International Education as the Associate Director for International Marketing and Recuitement and in eLearning for 3 years as the Program Spacialst 4. </p>
		<h3>What degree/certificate program are you pursuing?</h3>
		<p>I am not actually persuing a dgree or certificate. I am interested in taking a series of courses that focus on HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
		<h3>Why did you choose this degree/certificate?</h3>
		<p>This is part of a professional development plan as these skills are lacking in our office and we rely on IT often. As you know, IT is quite busy these days, so for our office to have these skills on hand would be an asset.</p>
		<h3>What artist/designer inspires you? Why?</h3>
		<p>My niece, Meela. She's 12 and is much more talented than I. She works on honing her drwaing skills daily and enjoys using her skills in drawing to also work her azrt into nail and hair projects/styles.</p>
		<h3>What is your favorite color?  (Please, use a hex code and style your answer with that color.)</h3>
		<p style="color:purple;">I'm a deep purple #7F00F5 fan.</p>
